# About me

I'm a pyhsics and computer scientist student at University of GÃ¶ttingen. 
I'm studying for teaching in German higher education schools

# My Projects

## University Realted Work
I'm currently working my master thesis about implementing real-life inspired simulations of easy and predicable physical systems in schools, to be coded by students but also used by teachers. This hopefully enables the students to get a deeper understanding of physical principles as well as acquire new coding skills.

## Private Work
I'm starting to build a classroom management app for teachers, that I want to use in my future lesson for better course management. This is currently early alpha, but once I reach somewhat of a beta phase, the repository will go public.
